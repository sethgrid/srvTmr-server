## srvTmr

srvTmr (pronounced Serve Timer) is a way to track how long food establishments take to serve food. The basic idea is to time when you get to a location until the time that you are served. 

#### The Future

The more this app is used and the more that the database of surve times grows, the more useful the application becomes. Long term goals include the ability to request a list of nearby eateries in the order of least time needed to begin eating. Imagine being at the office, and having a meeting in 20 minutes. Pull up srvTmr and get recommended food based on your location that takes into account drive time. That is the future of srvTmr. 

We need to begin collecting data on serve times. The information we collect is food establishment, timer data, submission time, and ip address (to check for spamming of the system). You can check out the simple client implementation here: https://github.com/sethgrid/srvTmr-client
